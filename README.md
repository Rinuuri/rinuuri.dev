## Rinuuri.dev
Is my personal portfolio website made with react and just as any of my other hobby projects, it's completely open source under AGPL

## How to run it?
The site is designed to run in the bun enviroment, so install bun according to the tutorial on https://bun.sh/ clone the repo and run
` bun i ` 
to install all dependencies and then run
` bun dev `
command in order to launch it in the development mode, that's it

## Hosted version
Right now the site is in development so it isn't hosted anywhere
